The utilization classes include, for example, compute or network or any other type of resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MeshMark provides an efficiency metric called Mesh Utilization Efficiency (MUE) that can help determine a score for a given resource utilization and the level of optimization. The MeshMark score will be able to help identify what the load latency is for a given workload, given the available resources. Overall, the goal with MeshMark is to take a number of different signals coming from a service mesh and combine them into an approach that can help organizations understand how well a deployment is, or isn&amp;#x27;t, working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need to better understand the performance of service meshes was further underscored by a report released on May 17 by the CNCF. The report found that 60% of surveyed organizations are using a service mesh in production today — and that key challenges for deployment of service meshes are a lack of guidance, blueprints, and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MeshMark: the Cloud Native Value Measurement]]></title><description><![CDATA[var _excluded = ["components"];

That layer of abstraction makes those underlying services more accessible to developers."), mdx("p", null, "Competition between service mesh platforms revolves around two core issues. Service meshes like Linkerd are considerably lighter-weight than, for example, Istio. That makes them simpler for a developer to implement. Istio\u2019s advocates argue that it\u2019s only a matter of time before enterprise IT organizations will need the richer set of capabilities their preferred service mesh enables. Of course, the more robust the feature set of a service mesh, the more likely it is to require an IT operations team that has been trained to implement and manage it. The other issue is to what degree a service mesh might need to be applied to both cloud-native and legacy application environments. Unlike Istio or Linkerd, the Kuma service mesh runs across both Kubernetes clusters and virtual machines."), mdx("p", null, "Regardless of the service Mesh platform selected, it is clear that programmatically managing network services is now much closer to becoming a mainstream part of any DevOps workflow.")));

As such, it now makes more sense to enable contributors working on both Istio and Kubernetes to work more closely with one another, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to apply to become an incubation project comes on the heels of the donation of Knative, an open source middleware for connecting Kubernetes clusters to serverless computing frameworks—also originally created by Google—to the CNCF. Assuming the CNCF accepts the Istio contribution, the three major cloud-native initiatives led by Google would all be governed under the auspices of a CNCF consortium that requires organizations to give up control over the trademarks attached to any open source project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan says IT organizations should expect to see ongoing innovation in the months ahead as competition between various service mesh platforms intensifies. At the same time, there may be opportunities to share advances across multiple service meshes being governed by the CNCF. Those service meshes currently include Linkerd, originally developed by Buoyant, and Kuma, originally developed by Kong, Inc. The CNCF is also home to a Meshery framework for managing service meshes created by Layer5 and a Service Mesh Interface (SMI) project originally created by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service meshes initially emerged as a way to manage APIs at scale instead of relying on proxy software or an API gateway alone. More recently, IT organizations have started to appreciate the programmable layer of abstraction that a service mesh creates above lower-level networking and security interfaces. That layer of abstraction makes those underlying services more accessible to developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition between service mesh platforms revolves around two core issues. Service meshes like Linkerd are considerably lighter-weight than, for example, Istio. That makes them simpler for a developer to implement. Istio’s advocates argue that it’s only a matter of time before enterprise IT organizations will need the richer set of capabilities their preferred service mesh enables. Of course, the more robust the feature set of a service mesh, the more likely it is to require an IT operations team that has been trained to implement and manage it. The other issue is to what degree a service mesh might need to be applied to both cloud-native and legacy application environments. Unlike Istio or Linkerd, the Kuma service mesh runs across both Kubernetes clusters and virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the service Mesh platform selected, it is clear that programmatically managing network services is now much closer to becoming a mainstream part of any DevOps workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Top 12 CNCF Sandbox Projects of 2021]]></title><description><![CDATA[var _excluded = ["components"];

The CNCF organization promotes innovations in accessible container technology by supporting open-source, vendor-neutral projects in the cloud-native ecosystem.
Its first, and perhaps most famous, project was the container orchestration platform Kubernetes, which has continued to lead and shape the industry.
Since then, CNCF has continued to develop open-source tools, standards, and resources that have formed the core of the cloud strategy of hundreds of organizations around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CNCF’s technical oversight committee (TOC) meets regularly to vote to decide which projects are accepted into the foundation.
Projects are ranked according to three maturity levels: Sandbox, Incubating, and Graduated — listed in increasing order of maturity.
The criteria for each maturity level depends on adoption by end users, quality of end products, and adherence to standards for security, governance, committers, and infrastructure.
Sandbox projects are usually projects in the early stages of development that show promise.
I’ve gathered some of the rising Sandbox projects added by the CNCF in 2021 for you, so that you can take a look at the tools that are driving the future of cloud native technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8.

The key projects operating under the Layer5 community include: &lt;code&gt;Meshery&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Learn Layer5&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Service Mesh Landscape&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Image Hub&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Meshery Operator&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Service Mesh Interface Conformance&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;NightHawk&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kuma:&lt;/strong&gt; Kuma is an open-source service mesh that provides support for multiple environments across clouds, such as Kubernetes and virtual machines. It was created by Kong, and it was recently added to CNCF as a Sandbox project. Moreover, Kuma is production-ready, and it is still under active development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Service Mesh Offers Promising Solution for Cloud Native Networking]]></title><description><![CDATA[var _excluded = ["components"];

alt=&quot;Kubernetes-platform&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A service mesh has become a critical part of platforms based on Kubernetes clusters. It provides both east-west and north-south traffic managementxi, security, observability, and shaping for services implemented by the cluster and supporting components. As clusters have grown in size and platforms have become comprised of many clusters, maintaining a consistent view, management, and policies for network layer 4 – 7 traffic has become increasingly complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, a number of vendors have extended control planes with a multi-cluster management layer such that they federate and manage service meshes at scale across multiple clouds and on-premises deployments. Both Hashicorp Consul and VMWare Tanzu NSX Service Mesh extend the service mesh control plane past the local service mesh to allow a management layer over multiple clouds and clusters. &lt;u&gt;The open source project &lt;a href=&quot;/cloud-native-management/meshery&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meshery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is also providing a service mesh management plane as separate software that can interact using the Service Mesh Interface or through built-for-purpose adapters for a variety of existing service mesh products and projects.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Kubernetes control planes, this extension of the service mesh control plane allows for consistent management and policies across clusters in different environments, a situation that is becoming more typical in enterprise IT applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service mesh control plane federation is an emerging feature of service mesh products. Unlike Kubernetes control planes, it is not yet commonplace, but Amalgam Insights predicts that we will see service mesh control plane federation become a normal part of the service mesh landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;h5 class=&quot;black-text&quot;&gt;Access the full &lt;a href=&quot;https://amalgaminsights.com/2018/12/20/the-view-from-kubeconcloudnativecon-seattle/&quot;&gt;research from Amalgam Insights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
